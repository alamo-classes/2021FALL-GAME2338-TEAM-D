## Summary

POOM is a recreation of DOOM on the "fantasy video game console" Pico-8. Doom is a 1993 title that pioneered the first-person shooter genre in which you play as a space 
marine who has to fight through hordes of demons that have taken over a military bases on the moons of Mars, as well as through Hell itself, in order to return to Earth. 
Pico-8 is a virtual machine that is designed to emulate to limitations of computers and video game consoles around the late 80's.

We (Team D) chose this game not only because it is readily avaliable to every member, but also because we know that, since it's a "port" of DOOM, it will be a complete 
experience that we can thoroughly playtest. It also has some things that we can already write up about at a quick glance, so it should make for good material for this 
project.
