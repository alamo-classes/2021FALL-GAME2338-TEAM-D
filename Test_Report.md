### Test Environment

The enviorment is post-release withing the [Itch.io](itch.io) website. The few bugs that are beign found have been rectified as well and visual issues. The game itself has no customization if the player wants to change keybindings but that does not affect the game.

#### Hardware Configuration

All tests were preformed on a basic PC withing three major browsers, Google Chrome, Firefox, and Opera GX. All browsers produce the same result.

### Recommendation

While the game is complete and runs as intended there is a few thigns that should be altered before this is considered a good game. First of the aiming and keybidings for those using a mouse and keyboard. IT's a bit uncanny having to use the arrow keys or the ESDF keys instead of the universal WASD. If the keybidings could atleast be alteres, and the aiming falls in like with the mouse movement, this game would be free of all issues.
